# twitter-unlike-unfollow-cleanup
Clean up your twitter: unfollow, unlike posts, delete your tweets

This is a collection of scripts and solutions I found, mainly so I can keep them in one place and reference when needed.

## Delete likes (unlike) 
[original gist and discussion](https://gist.github.com/aymericbeaumet/d1d6799a1b765c3c8bc0b675b1a1547d) 

NB: This script will unlike (remove "hearts") from your liked tweets but it will not remove the actual tweets themselves, as far as I can tell. 

### Alternative unlike script 
[see here](https://github.com/lukejones/delete-twitter-likes/blob/master/script.js) 

## Unfollow and/or remove followers 
[original script](https://github.com/canpurcek34/twitter-mass-actions/blob/main/twitter-mass-unfollow.js) 

NB: Make sure to change the language to the one you use on Twitter, otherwise it won't work 

## Delete your tweets (and more) 
Use [this app](https://tweetdelete.net/)
